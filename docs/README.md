# Welcome

This module allows you to control **Ableton Live** via OSC using the [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) control script.

It offers advanced visual feedback, including clip names, colors, and real-time audio meters directly on your Stream Deck buttons.

## Main Features

- **Fire/Stop clips**: Buttons for each clip, with name and color feedback
- **Visual audio meters**: Real-time peak meters displayed on buttons
- **Automated fades**: Audio Follow Video - fade tracks based on camera tally
- **Device control**: Toggle devices and control parameters with visual feedback
- **Dynamic variables**: Real-time display of track names, levels, and parameter values
- **Clip control**: Set loop points, toggle warping/looping

## Use Case

My main usage of Ableton Live in a broadcast workflow is to play out audio clips, automate track fades and other events based on camera tally states, and set parameters on plug-ins to adjust audio effects live.

If you need to control Ableton Live as a music producer, [**AbleSet**](https://ableset.app/) and its [**Companion module**](https://github.com/matlantin/companion-module-ableset) might be a better fit.

## Getting Started

Start by reading the [Installation & Setup](INSTALL.md) guide to configure the AbletonOSC script and connect it to Companion.
